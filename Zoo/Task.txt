Task Description:

Create a console application that simulates a zoo. This application should include classes for Animal, Zookeeper, and Zoo.

Animal Class: This class should have properties like Name, 
Species, Age, and HealthStatus. It should also have methods to set and get these properties.
Additionally, it should have a method MakeSound() that prints a sound that the animal makes.

Zookeeper Class: This class should have properties like Name and AssignedAnimals (a list of animals assigned to the zookeeper). 
It should also have methods to set and get these properties,
as well as a method to feed an animal (FeedAnimal) and a method to clean an animal's enclosure (CleanEnclosure).

Zoo Class: This class should have properties like Name and Animals (a list of all animals in the zoo). 
It should also have methods to set and get these properties, as well as methods to add an animal to the zoo (AddAnimal),
remove an animal from the zoo (RemoveAnimal), and assign a zookeeper to an animal (AssignZookeeperToAnimal).

The Animal class should inherit from a base class called LivingBeing, which includes common properties like Name and HealthStatus. 
The Zookeeper and Zoo classes should contain instances of the Animal class.

Remember to use appropriate access modifiers (public, private, protected) 
to encapsulate your data and ensure that it can only be accessed through your class methods.

This task should give you a good understanding of how to use classes, objects, and inheritance in C#. Good luck with your codealong!
